//To change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: “//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]” for example “//;\n1;2” should return three where the delimiter is ‘;’.
//Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception “Negatives not allowed” - and the negative that was passed in. If there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message.
//Numbers greater than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001 + 13 = 15.
//Allow multiple delimiters like this: “//[delim1][delim2]\n” for example “//*%\n1*2%3” should return 6.
